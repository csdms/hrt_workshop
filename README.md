This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook used as one of the [Landlab](https://landlab.github.io/) tutorials for the 
[EarthCube Advancing the Analysis of HRT Workshop](https://opentopography.org/workshops/earthcube-advancing-analysis-hrt-workshop-2).

Overland flow, particularly the infiltration-excess mechanism, is affected by the nature of water input through precipitation. 
This [Jupyter notebook](ASU_tutorial.ipynb) demonstrates how to use the high resolution topography data 
from [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org/) and the Landlab model components to delineate the watershed 
and simulate the overland flow for a study area in the Boulder County.

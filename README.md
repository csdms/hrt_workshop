This workshop will be divided into two parts. In the first half we will provide a
brief tutorial introduction to the theory and implementation of *Landlab* for landscape
evolution modeling. We will cover grid representation, working with data fields,
and using *Landlab* components to create new integrated models.

In the second half we will turn our focus to how we can incorporate high-resolution
topography data into the *Landlab* environment. In both parts participants will
be able to run hands-on examples and be free to write and run their own *Landlab*
code. This clinic is intended both for beginners, who may have little to no
experience using the *Landlab* library, as well as for more advanced *Landlab* users.
Prior experience with Python programming will be helpful.

### Local installation

If you would like to run these notebooks on your personal computer, you can do
that too. You will need to have a Python installation (we recommend the
[Anaconda distribution](anaconda-download), but others should work as well).

If you have `git` installed, you can get the lessons by cloning this repository,

    git clone git@github.com:csdms/hrt_workshop

You can, alternatively, [download a zip file](hrt-workshop-zip) of the repository.

Once you have the source code, install the necessary dependencies to run the
notebooks into your current environment (either *pip* or *conda*/*mamba* should work),

    cd hrt_workshop
    pip install -r requirements.in
